text_facil: 'There''s been 15 years with more than a hundred memorable concerts, two published albums, participating in numerous compilation albums (two of them in Japan) and with unforgettable moments like Rototom Sunsplash''s performance as the backing band of the legendary trombonist Rico Rodriguez. And to celebrate this so special anniversary they publish "Fàcil" (Easy). Easy because in Root Diamoons music flows quietly, without big virtuosity doses, but with high love and respect awareness towards music and people who listens to it, plays it and loves it. And so easy, in all the positive meanings, are the 6 tracks which shape this EP: three marvellous ska and three elegant rocksteadies which transfer us to Jamaica in the 60''s, but with lyrics that speak about life in the Barcelona of the 21st century, about gestures, emotions, and also big contradictions. And to wrap it up and provide the perfect atmosphere, its recording and treatment were in hands of two vibrating waves magicians which are Chalart58 and Xavi "Leak" Farré. Prepare your best fruit juice, clink the ice cubes in your favourite liquor, get your cigar ready, and enjoy these melodies Root Diamoons offer with so much love. Let''s be easy!'
text_tast: 'After ten years on the stage, "Tot al seu temps", Root Diamoons'' second album, arrives at a crucial moment. With a close rapport between musicians, both band members and guests (of the stature of Greg Lee from the Californian band Hepcat, the New Yorker David Hillyard and the Italian Mr. T-Bone), and Berta Gratacòs, a singer who shows her talent by achieving registers characteristic of the great ladies of jazz, it is a work able to seduce. Subtle. Elegant. Sophisticated. With romantic airs. Exploring places where music with class (Jamaican jazz, rock steady, American jazz) provides a magnificent pretext to make the message known to the one who is able to appreciate it. To miss it would be to tempt fate. To lose oneself in it, is really worth it.'
text_woe: '"With other eyes" is a safe bet from the Silver Bullets (Brixton Records) record label: fourteen tracks with a dance vocation, which make you face life with a different philosophy, with positivity and a desire to scratch deeply beneath the surface, like cat''s claws. Like a follower of Jamaican music roots looking for its essence to appeal to the field of jazz or like an adolescent in love who falls head over heels for an uptown girl, who could be called Laila or Mary Ann.'
